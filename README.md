# The progression of economies and societies

Peasants represent the agrarian society's base, where the majority of people work in agriculture. Farmers are a step up, often owning or managing land for agricultural purposes. Manufacturers indicate a shift towards industrialization, where production moves beyond simple agriculture to include goods production. Energy is crucial for powering industrial processes and transportation, which becomes essential for moving goods and people efficiently. Together, these terms paint a picture of economic development, from agrarian to industrial, highlighting the evolution of labor, production, and infrastructure.
